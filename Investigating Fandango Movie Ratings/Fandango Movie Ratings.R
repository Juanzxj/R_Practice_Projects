#  title: "Analyzing Recent Movie Ratings on Fandango"

#   ## Introduction
#   In 2015, Walt Hickey from FiveThirtyEight analyzed movie ratings on Fandango and uncovered a significant discrepancy between the ratings displayed to users and the actual ratings stored in the HTML of the page. He found that Fandango consistently rounded up movie ratings, leading to inflated ratings displayed on the site. The analysis revealed that Fandango's system often rounded ratings up to the nearest half-star, and in some cases, even to the nearest whole star, resulting in higher displayed ratings compared to the actual ratings.
# Fandango's response to Hickey's findings was that the biased rounding was due to a bug in their system, which they promised to fix. In this project, we aim to analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether Fandango has made any adjustments to their rating system following Hickey's analysis. Our goal is to assess whether the rounding practices have changed and if the displayed ratings are now more accurately reflecting the actual ratings.

# Fandango_Ratingvalue:	The Fandango ratingValue for the film, as pulled from the HTML of each page. This is the actual average score the movie obtained.# Metacritic_user_nom	The Metacritic user score for the film, normalized to a 0 to 5 point system
#Fandango_votes:	The number of user votes the film had on Fandango
# Fandango_Difference	The difference between the presented Fandango_Stars and the actual Fandango_Ratingvalue

# movie:	the name of the movie
# year:	the release year of the movie
# fandango:	the Fandango rating of the movie (user score)

# #Check the Fan Rating System in the Post-Hickey Dataset
# # The movie_ratings_16_17.csv dataset (post-Hickey) doesn't include the number of fan ratings, 
# so we'll need to find an alternative way to ensure that it contains popular movies.
# # One approach is to compare the movies in this dataset with those in the pre-Hickey dataset. 
# If thereâ€™s significant overlap with the movies that had a high number of fan ratings in 2015, 
# this suggests that the dataset is likely to contain popular movies.
